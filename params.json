I'm **iTweaksUninstaller**,  the open source application made for Windows users, by *[Leonardo Alfreducci](http://github.com/Sn0wCooder)*, to simple uninstall all tweaks in once time on your jailbroken iOS device.\r\n\r\nI recommend to install **safestart** and **NO PLS RECOVERY ** *(optional)* from *[angelXwind Repository](http://cydia.angelxwind.net)*, because if your device still in boot loop, you can simple remove all tweaks on it with this application. After you can use *[Putty](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html)* to run command `killall sshd` command.\r\n\r\nProblem? *[Contact me](mailto:leoalfreducci@gmail.com)*!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
